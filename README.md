# Indeed-Job-Scraping-Project
As I was moving close to my graduation, there was a need to search and apply for more and more job openings for the roles that I was looking for. In the process, I had to navigate to Indeed and search every-time I sat down for doing some applications. To automate this process, I wrote a Machine Learning script that picks up basic info from a doc file (about job title and location etc) and compiles a list of available job openings on Indeed, in an easy to use excel file. More details on the readme file.
